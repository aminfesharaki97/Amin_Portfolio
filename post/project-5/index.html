<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this analysis is to statistically investigate the
association of tailpipe carbon dioxide emissions in grams per mile to
annual primary-fuel petroleum consumption in barrels after controlling
for combined miles-per-gallon for the primary fuel type, vehicle
manufacturer, make, model, engine displacement, engine cylinders,
transmission type, and combined luggage and passenger volume in cubic
feet. The hypothesis is that multiple linear regression can accurately
model CO~2~ emissions with critical variables from the vehicle
characteristics. A bivariate analysis found that the proportion of
regular gasoline is higher than the population; regular gasoline creates
a significant and most considerable impact when analyzing CO~2~ tailpipe
emissions for all vehicle types. Investigating the associations showed
that unknown vehicles contribute the most among all vehicle types and
are statistically significant with high associations to emissions, while
regular gasoline has the highest association relative to all emission
levels. Statistical correlations found that annual petroleum consumption
is most strongly correlated with CO~2~ emissions, while primary fuel
type had the weakest correlation. The final model created removed
significant multicollinearity concerns but still exhibited some level of
multicollinearity. According to the final model, the model's intercept
was 60.31 grams per mile of tailpipe CO~2~ emissions. The coefficients
for petroleum consumption, combined miles per gallon, engine
displacement, cylinders, and volume are respectively 24.43, -1.257,
1.51, 0.51, and 0.00075. All predictor variables resulted in p-values
&lt;.0001 except volume, which was .6461. The final model had five degrees
of freedom and an F value of 402,618, resulting in a p-value less than
.0001 with a confidence level of 95%. These findings indicate that a
final multiple regression model explains tailpipe CO~2~ emission
variance adequately.</p>

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Greenhouse gas emissions have been one of the primary factors to global
warming and climate change. Evidence suggests that vehicle
transportation caused 29% of the total greenhouse gas in 2019 (U.S.
Energy Information Administration, 2019). According to Salvi et al.
(2013), annual primary fuel consumption positively correlates to carbon
dioxide emissions, meaning we can decrease CO~2~ emissions by decreasing
petroleum consumption. This notion suggests reducing carbon dioxide
emissions by roughly 20% if every automobile manufacturer designed
fuel-efficient vehicles. Awareness of the relationship between carbon
dioxide emissions and petroleum consumption gives way to more research
and hopefully identifying better ways to design cars to reduce CO~2~
tailpipe emissions. Therefore, a model should be developed for CO~2~
emissions in an effort for manufacturers to reduce carbon emissions from
their cars when designing a new vehicle. Additionally, consumers may
also be interested in viewing the model when deciding what car to buy to
reduce their carbon footprint.</p>
<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>
<p>The research objective for this study is to statistically investigate
the association of primary fuel tailpipe carbon dioxide emissions in
grams per mile to annual primary-fuel petroleum consumption in barrels
after controlling for combined miles-per-gallon for the primary fuel
type, vehicle manufacturer, engine displacement, transmission type,
engine cylinders, and combined luggage and passenger volume in cubic
feet. The goal is to create a model that accurately predicts tailpipe
CO~2~ emissions-based vehicle characteristics to assist automobile
manufacturers with reducing their carbon footprint when designing new
vehicles. The hypothesis is that multiple linear regression can predict
tailpipe carbon dioxide emissions.</p>
<h2 id="generalized-objective-formula">Generalized Objective Formula</h2>
<p>To statistically analyze the research objective, a generalized model was
made to investigate the independent variables that impact tailpipe CO~2~
emissions, as seen in (1). The hypothesis is that multiple linear
regression can accurately model CO~2~ emissions with critical variables
from the vehicle characteristics. Furthermore, the goal for the model,
using a linear combination of vehicle characteristics, constant, and an
error term ($\epsilon)$ will attempt to quantify each characteristic
impact on carbon dioxide emissions and predict carbon dioxide emissions.</p>

<h2 id="data-collection">Data Collection</h2>
<p>This study uses data downloaded from FuelEconomoy.gov, which includes
various characteristics of 43,177 vehicle models from 1984 to 2021.
Statistical data analysis was performed using a Lenovo ThinkStation P330
Tower with an Intel Xeon E-2186G 6 Core Processor on Windows 10 Pro for
Workstations 64. In addition, the software used to carry out data
calculations were MATLAB R2020b, Microsoft Excel for Microsoft Office
365 (64-bit), SAS Enterprise Guide 7.1 (64-bit), and Tableau 2020.3. The
CSV was opened in Microsoft Excel to convert the data into a table
format with emissions, fuel type, make, transmission type, vehicle type
categories. The final combined table was imported to MATLAB for
distribution curve fitting and SAS for statistical analysis, including
bivariate frequencies, Pearson correlation coefficients, association,
and chi-squared testing.</p>
<h2 id="population-characteristics">Population Characteristics</h2>
<p>The data initially consisted of 43,177 samples. After removing the blank
and null values through SAS, a total of 42,917 samples were used for
descriptive statistical analysis. The samples include vehicles from 138
different manufacturers. Important population characteristics have been
identified for each sample. Barrels08 represents the annual petroleum
consumption in barrels for each primary fuel type: premium gasoline,
midgrade gasoline, regular gasoline, diesel, natural gas, and
electricity. Combo08 represents the combined MPG, displ indicates engine
displacement in liters, and cylinders show each vehicle's number of
engine cylinders. Transmission types include manual or automatic for
each vehicle sample.</p>
<p>Moreover, the dataset also includes unknown vehicle types, hatchback,
passenger two-door, and passenger four-door, and the vehicle volume in
cubic feet. However, it is essential to note that FuelEconomy.gov did
not require interior volume dimensions for two-seater passenger cars or
any vehicle classified as trucks: vans, pickups, special purpose
vehicles, minivans, and sport utility vehicles. Lastly, the vehicles are
grouped into the following categories based on how much tailpipe
emissions were emitted: ultra-low emissions, very-low emissions, low
emissions, standard, polluter, and gross polluter. All research fields
(variables) with their respective field description are discussed in
Table 1.</p>
<h2 id="descriptive-statistics">Descriptive Statistics</h2>
<p>The continuous data variables include CO~2~ emissions, petroleum
consumption, volume, engine displacement. The discrete variables in the
dataset are the combined MPG / MPGe and engine cylinders. The mean value
of CO~2~ Tailpipe emissions was 465.54 grams per mile with a standard
deviation of 119.88, indicating a positively skewed distribution. For
the annual petroleum consumption in barrels, the mean value was 17.25,
with a standard deviation of 4.49. The conversion from barrels to
gallons is 1 barrel equals 42 gallons. In addition, the mean value of
volume was 66.88 cubic feet with a standard deviation of 69.12. As
mentioned previously, this value is not accurate since interior
dimensions for two passenger vehicles and trucks were not required to be
recorded in the sample set. Lastly, the mean value of engine
displacement was 3.29 liters with a standard deviation of 1.36. In
addition to descriptive statistics for each variable**,** Table 2 shows
the ranges for each variable.</p>
<p>Categorical variables of interest include primary fuel type, vehicle
type, transmission type, manufacturer. From analyzing the entire dataset
of 43,177 samples, primary fuel types included 29.6% premium gasoline,
0.3% midgrade gasoline, 66.5% regular gasoline, 2.8% diesel, 0.1%
natural gas, and 0.6% electricity. Vehicle types include 11.7%
hatchback, 14.8% passenger two-door, 27.8% passenger four-door, and
45.7% were considered unknown. Transmission types include 70.0%
automatic and 30.0% manual. Furthermore, the emissions category is an
ordinal value based on the value of each car's respective tailpipe
CO~2~ emissions. Emission level categories are as follows: 0.72%
ultra-low emission, 0.89% very-low emission, 12.87% low emission, 68.42%
standard, 13.66% polluter, and 3.41% gross polluter. The emission
category in which each vehicle fell into was determined by the
population mean and standard deviation, as shown in Table 3.</p>
<p>The number of cylinders is a discrete variable, and therefore
determining the mean and standard deviation holds no value. Thus, a box
was made for tailpipe CO~2~ Emissions relative to the number of engine
cylinders, shown in Figure 1, to analyze the discrete variable further.
Electric vehicles are not included in the visualization since electric
cars typically have no cylinders. Furthermore, there are only 61 data
points of 2-cylinder vehicles, including Mazda RX7/8 models and BMW I3
models. In addition, the 16-cylinder vehicles were exclusive to only the
Bugatti manufacturer with only 13 data points. Thus, the 2-cylinder and
16-cylinder vehicles will not be compared to the 3-cylinder, 4-cylinder,
5-cylinder, 6-cylinder, 8-cylinder, 10-cylinder, and 12-cylinder
vehicles. Moreover, the average tailpipe CO~2~ emissions increase as the
number of cylinders increases, as seen in Figure 1**.** Excluding
2-cylinder and 16-cylinder vehicles, 3-cylinder vehicles showed the
slightest variance among all other cylinder values and had the lowest
average tailpipe emissions. After 3-cylinder vehicles, the 5-cylinder
vehicles have the second-lowest variation with a low number of outliers.
By contrast, the 4-, 5-, 6-, 8-, 10-, 12- cylinder models exhibit
significant variations across all vehicle types with many more sample
points.</p>
<h2 id="bivariate-frequency">Bivariate Frequency</h2>
<p>Table 3 represents the bivariate frequency of four different vehicle
types and two different transmission types across six categories of fuel
types for a total of 43,177 samples. Within the table, the independent
variables are unknown, hatchback, passenger two-door, and passenger
four-door vehicle types and automatic and manual transmission types. In
contrast, the dependent variables are the fuel types of premium
gasoline, midgrade gasoline, regular gasoline, diesel, natural gas, and
electricity. The percentages of each variable for the total population
are shown in Table 3. There are proportionally more automatic
transmissions than manual transmissions across all fuel types regarding
transmission types.</p>
<p>Moreover, premium gasoline accounts for 12,801 samples (29.64% of the
total population), with passenger four-door vehicle types having the
most significant proportion of 37.8%. Unknown vehicles and passenger
two-door vehicles have similar proportions of 27.3% and 24.7%,
respectively. Midgrade gasoline has 130 samples (0.30% of the total
population), with unknown vehicle types having the most significant
proportion of 69.2% and passenger four-door having the second largest
proportion of 21.5%. Regular gasoline has 28,733 samples (66.54% of the
total population), with unknown vehicle types having the majority
proportion of 53.4% and passenger four-door having the second highest of
21.5%. Diesel accounts for 1,196 samples (2.77% of the total
population), with unknown having the largest proportion of 57.3% while
the passenger four-door has the second-highest proportion of 21.5%.
Natural gas has the lowest sample points of 60 (0.14% of the total
population), with unknown having the largest proportion of 56.7% and
passenger four-door with 38.3%. Lastly, electric vehicles have a total
of 257 sample points (0.60% of the total population), with hatchbacks
having the largest proportion, 40.9%, and the second highest being
unknown vehicle types with 32.7%.</p>
<p>In other words, unknown vehicles account for the highest percentage of
all vehicle types for midgrade gasoline, regular gasoline, diesel, and
natural gas. Furthermore, regular gasoline has the highest proportion
(66.54%) across all other fuel types. Thus, the proportion of regular
gasoline is higher than the population; regular gasoline creates a
significant and most considerable impact when analyzing CO~2~ tailpipe
emissions for all vehicle types. The high bivariate frequency can cause
the average to sway more in favor of regular gasoline towards its
average tailpipe emission value. In addition, the p-value is extremely
low (&lt;.0001) for all these proportions, which indicates that there is a
statistically significant difference between the proportions of each
independent variable and the dependent variable.</p>
<h2 id="associations">Associations</h2>
<p>Table 4 outlines the association of emissions category by fuel type and
other characteristics: primary fuel type, vehicle type, and transmission
type. The CO~2~ emissions are converted into categorical data to show
that our dependent variable is relative to some of the independent
variables in the model. The dependent variable in this table is the
CO~2~ emission levels, while the independent variables are the primary
fuel type, vehicle type, and transmission type. These characteristics
have also acquired a p-value of less than .0001, which indicates a
statistically significant association concerning the different levels of
emission categories. Of the total population, 68.42% of vehicles fell
under the standard category, and 45.7% of all vehicle types are
classified as unknown. Additionally, as mentioned previously, 70% of
vehicles are automatic transmission types. In short, unknown vehicles
contribute the most among all vehicle types and are statistically
significant with high associations to emissions, while regular gasoline
has the highest association relative to all emission levels.</p>
<h1 id="results">Results</h1>
<h2 id="probability-density-function">Probability Density Function</h2>
<p>A normal probability density function was determined for the CO~2~
emissions, as seen in (2). Additionally, the independent variable in the
density function is CO~2~ tailpipe emissions. When considering the
practicality of this density function, it was determined that any value
less than 0 CO~2~ emissions would result in zero chance since vehicles
having a negative carbon dioxide emission is impossible because a
vehicle cannot have negative carbon dioxide emissions based on current
technology. In addition, the probability distribution exhibits a normal
bell-shaped curve which allows the density function to predict what
percentage of CO~2~ emissions will fall at a specific value, as shown in
Figure 2. For research purposes, the data was forced into a normal curve
by creating a modified number of bins to get the data points as close as
possible to a normal distribution. The center of the curve for the CO~2~
probability distribution function with a frequency histogram has an
approximate value of 450 grams per mile, similar to the mean value of
465.54 calculated through SAS. Due to the normally distributed histogram
and probability chart, the density function predicts 95% of CO~2~
emissions values to fall between 225.75 and 705.27 by calculating two
standard deviations above and below the mean as shown in Figure #.</p>
<p>$${PDF}_{CO2} = f(x;\mu = 465.538,\sigma = 119.88) = \left{ \begin{matrix}

<h2 id="heading-1"></h2>
<h2 id="pearson-correlation-coefficients">Pearson Correlation Coefficients</h2>
<p>Table 5 displayed the Pearson correlation coefficients (r) for all the
vehicle characteristics in the data set. The correlation values resulted
in a p-value &lt;0.0001, indicating that the variable was statistically
significant at a confidence level of 95%. With respect to statistical
correlation, absolute values of r &gt; .75 describe a strong relationship
while absolute values of .25 &lt; r &lt; .50 indicate a weak relationship
and r &lt;.25 values are considered very weak relationships (Statology,
2020). The strongest positive correlation relative to CO~2~ emissions
was the annual petroleum consumption in barrels for fuel type (.9885),
which supports the notion that a higher amount of CO~2~ is associated
with higher levels of annual petroleum consumption. The strongest
negative correlation was the combined MPG (-.9184), indicating a strong
negative linear correlation concerning CO~2~ emissions. The inverse
correlation shows that the amount of CO~2~ emitted tends to decrease as
the value of MPG increases. Other variables with relatively strong
positive correlations concerning CO~2~ tailpipe emissions include the
derived value based on classified CO~2~ tailpipe emissions (.8894),
engine displacement in liters (.7954), and the number of engine
cylinders (.7438).</p>
<p>From the Pearson correlation table, two variables exhibit weak
correlations and two variables that exhibit a very weak relationship to
the CO~2~ tailpipe emission, shown in Table #. The two weak correlations
are vehicle volume (-.4342) and vehicle type (-.3636). Very weak
statistical correlations include make ID (-.2157) and primary fuel type
(-.1128) being the weakest correlated across all variables. Note that
negative correlation values indicate an inverse relationship, as
previously mentioned. Furthermore, statistical correlations of make ID
and primary fuel type are also weak across all other variables. Thus,
the weak correlations support the notion that the nominal and ordinal
variables tend to impact the CO~2~ tailpipe emissions the least among
other data types based on the Pearson Correlation Coefficient Table.</p>
<h2 id="pearsons-chi-square-test">Pearson&rsquo;s Chi-Square Test</h2>
<p>Emissions category and vehicle types had a correlation value of .3054,
indicating a weak correlation indicated Table. Therefore, a chi-squared
test for independence or homogeneity was necessary to investigate
further the significance of the association between the association of
vehicle types relative to the emissions category. The null hypothesis of
homogeneity states that the proportion of the emissions category is the
same for each population (Devore, 2016). In contrast, the alternative
hypothesis states that the emissions categories are not homogeneously
relative to vehicle types. A chi-squared test of independence focuses on
the lack of association between the variables. Therefore, emissions
category and vehicle type are independent of one another is the null
hypothesis for independence. Furthermore, the chi-squared homogeneity
test was performed for this study, resulting in the null hypothesis
claiming that emissions categories are homogenous with respect to the
four vehicle types.</p>
<p>In addition, a table of expected values, as shown in Table 7, was also
created in order to perform chi-squared testing. Category combination
was unnecessary because all cells in the expected count table are at
least five, allowing the chi-squared test for homogeneity to be applied
safely. As indicated in Table 8, the chi-squared test resulted in a
total value of 9,406.17, and with 15 degrees of freedom, the p-value was
less than .001. With a p-value this small, the null hypothesis would be
rejected at any practicable significance level. Therefore, the
hypothesis of homogeneity is rejected in favor of the alternative
hypothesis that the distribution of reason for nonconformity is
different for the emission categories.</p>
<p>On the other hand, an immense sample set can potentially cause inflated
chip-squared statistics and decrease the p-value, and in this case, the
total chi-squared value was so large that the p-value could be
incorrectly low. The most notable example in the dataset is that 173
gross polluters were expected, but only one was observed. Therefore, a
secondary analysis is needed to review the validity of the chi-squared
test further.</p>
<h2 id="multicollinearity">Multicollinearity</h2>
<p>Multicollinearity issues can arise when two or more predictor
(explanatory) variables in a multiple regression model are related to
each other and likewise related to the response variable (Akinwande et
al., 2015). In other words, multicollinearity can occur when independent
variables in a regression model are correlated. As such, Table 5
identifies predictor variables that are strongly correlated with each
other (r &lt; |.75|): emissions category with petroleum consumption
(.8791) and combined mpg (-.8415), engine displacement with petroleum
consumption (.7843), MPG (-.7327) and cylinders (.9406), volume with
vehicle type (.7418), and cylinders with petroleum consumption (.7438).
However, strongly correlated independent variables do not always imply
that there will be a significant estimation problem. In other words,
correlation is not collinearity but instead an indication of potential
multicollinearity. Therefore, further investigation is required before
removing the variables.</p>
<p>In addition, the initially planned model includes categorical data
non-indicator variables, which were assigned numerical IDs. The model
contains categorical predictor variables: make ID, vehicle type,
emissions category, transmission type, and primary fuel type. Converting
categorical data to numerical IDs is not sufficient enough to be used in
regression models. SAS converted the categorical data into discrete
numbers. Therefore, the residuals, the vertical deviation from the
estimated regression line, treat the data as discrete rather than
categorical data. Instead, the categorical data should be in values of 0
and 1 or as dummy variables. The model&rsquo;s categorical data as numerical
IDs that increase is incorrect because it imposes an ordering on the
categories. Categorical variables with C possible categories into a
multiple regression model require the use of C-1 indicator variables
which are not present in the models provided (Devore, 2016).</p>
<h2 id="initial-regression-model">Initial Regression Model</h2>
<p>Based on (1), a multi regression model was made (3). The response, or
dependent variable, was CO~2~ emissions, while the predictor, or
explanatory or independent variables, are petroleum consumption in,
combined miles-per-gallon, vehicle manufacturer, engine displacement,
engine cylinders, and combined luggage and passenger volume. The
originally planned model used 42,917 samples and yielded a dependent
mean of 465.54 and an adjusted R^2^ value of .9828; the R^2^ value
refers to the variation in CO~2~ emissions by the variance of the
independent variables. However, this does not necessarily represent a
near-perfect model and instead raises over-fitting concerns.
Over-fitting refers to situations where the model fails to generalize
estimates outside its own dataset (Rigg &amp; Hankins, 2015). Thus, having a
very high R^2^ value should be investigated further to see if the
predictor variables may not necessarily belong.</p>
<p>$${CO}<em>{2}Tailpipegpm = 79.5534 + 20.7437(barrels08) - 2.5356(combo08) + 0.0033\left( make</em>{id} \right) + 2.1722(displ) + 2.2629(cylinders) - .0078(volume) - 0.4136(vehtype) + 12.8766(emissionscat) + 0.7799\left( transtype_{id} \right) + 2.9902(prifueltype) + \in$$</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>Moreover, the original model contained variables with high variance
inflation factors (VIF) which &ldquo;measures how much multicollinearity has
increased the variance of a slope estimate&rdquo; (Stine, 2011). The VIF
values between five and ten are typically used to indicate problems with
multicollinearity (Tay, 2017). Using this threshold, high VIFs in the
model were include annual petroleum consumption (9.34), combined MPG
(6.08), engine displacement (7.29), and cylinders (6.47). However,
further investigation of these variables was not determined to have a
severe enough impact on removing the variables for the final model. To
summarize, the initially planned model can predict data based on that
data set. However, it would not predict anything else about the other
data sets due to the issues surrounding categorical indicator variables,
overfitting, and multicollinearity issues.</p>
<h2 id="final-regression-model">Final Regression Model</h2>
<p>Categorical non-indicator variables (make ID, vehicle type, emissions
category, transmission type, and primary fuel type) were removed for the
final model due to multicollinearity concerns. In addition, the model
removes 19,903 observations due to null values in order to provide the
most accurate model possible given the dataset from FuelEconomy.gov.
Missing volume samples (19,731), all associated with unknown vehicle
types, accounted for the majority (99.1%) of the null observations. (4)
represents the final model to predict tailpipe CO~2~ emissions with the
following predictor variables: annual petroleum consumption (barrels08),
combined MPG (combo08), engine displacement (displ), cylinders, and
volume. The model was determined to have an adjusted R^2 value of
0.9886, suggesting 98.86% of the variance in CO~2~ emissions in relation
to the predictor variables. The dependent mean is 415.94, which is lower
than the original planned model&rsquo;s dependent mean (465.54). The model
also resulted in a p-value less than .0001 with 5 degrees of freedom, as
opposed to 10 degrees of freedom in the initial model. Therefore, the
final model had a lower variance coefficient, lower error value, and no
categorical variables indicating a more accurate model when comparing
both models.</p>
<p>$${CO}_{2}Tailpipegpm = 60.2159 + 24.4364(barrels08) - 1.2573(combo08) + 1.5163(displ) + 0.5106(cylinders) + 0.0008(volume)$$</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>Although, reducing the variable count in the regression model does not
entirely remove the multicollinearity concerns. The new model
statistically investigates the association of tailpipe carbon dioxide
emissions to annual consumption in barrels after controlling combined
miles per gallon, engine displacement, engine cylinders, and volume.
Table 5 reveals a multicollinearity issue within the final model due to
the strong inverse correlation of .9050 between petroleum consumption
and combined MPG, causing variable inflation. Intuitively, this makes
sense in practical applications where fuel-efficient cars with lower
miles per gallon will probably consume less petroleum.</p>
<h1 id="discussion">Discussion</h1>
<h2 id="hypothesis">Hypothesis</h2>
<p>According to the final model, the model's intercept was 60.31 grams per
mile of tailpipe CO~2~ emissions. The coefficients for petroleum
consumption, combined miles per gallon, engine displacement, cylinders,
and volume are respectively 24.43, -1.257, 1.51, 0.51, and 0.00075. All
predictor variables resulted in p-values &lt;.0001 except volume, which
was .6461. The relatively high p-value from volume could be from
removing 19,731 samples which made up 45.97% of all samples (42,917)
used in the dataset.</p>
<p>The objective of this analysis is to statistically investigate the
association of tailpipe carbon dioxide emissions in grams per mile to
annual primary-fuel petroleum consumption in barrels after controlling
for combined miles-per-gallon for the primary fuel type, vehicle
manufacturer, make, model, engine displacement, engine cylinders,
transmission type, and combined luggage and passenger volume in cubic
feet. This study's null hypothesis is that there are no correlations
between CO~2~ tailpipe emissions and petroleum consumption; in other
words, vehicle characteristics do not impact CO~2~ emissions. In
contrast, the alternative hypothesis suggests a relationship between the
independent variables from the vehicle characteristics and CO~2~
emissions.</p>
<p>The final model had five degrees of freedom and an F value of 402,618,
resulting in a p-value less than .0001 with a confidence level of 95%.
Thus, the null hypothesis is rejected, and the alternative hypothesis is
accepted. We can further conclude that there is a significant
association between CO~2~ emissions and annual petroleum consumption. In
other words, for every 1 barrel of annual petroleum consumed, tailpipe
CO~2~ emissions are expected to increase by 24.43 grams per mile if all
other predictor variables were fixed. However, by accepting the
alternative hypothesis, there is a risk of having a Type I error if the
null hypothesis should have been accepted instead. In conclusion, the
final multiple regression model proved to explain tailpipe CO~2~
emission variance adequately.</p>
<h2 id="strengths-and-limitations">Strengths and Limitations</h2>
<p>The research project has a voluminous data set of 43,177; this can be
seen as a strength because of the enormous magnitude of sample points
which can indicate a good representation of the population. By having a
large sample size, we can move closer to having a normal distribution in
the dataset. Additionally, larger samples are more robust to outliers
and provide a more accurate population parameter estimate. Furthermore,
another strength of the study is that it is continuously updated to
provide more accurate results. For example, FuelEconomy.gov mentions
that the sample set contains the MPG for all 1985-2997 models, and some
2011-2016 model years have been updated. Similarly, the fuel prices for
gasoline and diesel are updated every week. However, having such a large
sample size can cause some problems due to missing information.
According to Devore (2016), large sample sizes can amplify the
differences in estimated P values, causing a potential problem when
analyzing the values in conjunction with the null hypothesis.</p>
<p>Moreover, the data notes in the excel file highlight potential data
limitation issues if the whole data set is used, which can impact the
precision and accuracy when modeling the data. For example, one
limitation would be the interior volume dimensions since the volume
dimensions are not required for two-seater passenger cars or any vehicle
classified as a truck. From the data provided by fuel economy, there are
19,731 data points with a volume of 0. Another limitation is the number
of data points (261) with no cylinder values, and that unrounded MPG
values are not available for some vehicles. Lastly, according to
FuelEconomy.gov, the tailpipe CO~2~ is based on EPA testing for model
years 2013 and beyond and using an EPA emission factor of -1 (not
available) for previous model years. Thus, if the whole dataset
(43,177), the limitations far exceed the strengths due to missing data
values.</p>
<h2 id="future-research">Future Research</h2>
<p>Future research should consider the potential effects of these
limitations more carefully. One example of avoiding a limitation is
creating a dataset that uses the same EPA testing across all
observations. Future research should also examine strategically better
sampling methods to avoid potential bias. For example, the 16-cylinder
vehicles were exclusive to 14 Bugatti&rsquo;s only. Therefore, providing more
samples of other supercars can be helpful when including 16-cylinder
vehicles in the dataset. In addition, a different model can be created
to predict CO~2~ tailpipe emissions of two-seater passenger cars where
the interior volume dimensions were provided, resulting in null values
skewing the data points. Similarly could be done to any vehicle
classified as trucks: vans, pickups, special purpose vehicles, minivan,
and sport utility vehicles. Moreover, future studies should also further
develop and confirm these initial findings with more samples to provide
manufacturers with a model of vehicle characteristics to meet their
reduced CO2 emission goals.</p>
